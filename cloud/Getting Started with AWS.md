### Cloud Economics and Billing

- AWS의 금액을 책정하는 요소 2가지
  - Compute
    - Charged per hour/second
    - Varies by instance type
  - Storage
    - Charged typically per GB
  - Data transfer
    - Outbound is aggregated and charged
    - Inbound has no charge
      - 보통 업로드 할땐 요금을 책정하지 않더라도, 다운로드 내려받을땐 돈을 받는거와 비슷!
    - Charged typically per GB
    - 같은 Region 내에 존재하는 AWS 서비스 간의 데이터 통신

- 어떻게 금액을 지불하는지
  - Pay for what you use
  - pay less when **you reserve** -> Reserved Instances **(RIs)**
    - 최대 75%까지 할인
    - All Upfront Reserved Instance **(AURI)** -> largest discount
    - Partial Upfront Reserved Instance **(PURI)** -> lower discounts
    - No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance **(NURI)** -> smaller discount
  - pay less **when you use more** and as **AWS grows** (AWS의 성장!)
    - 사용량이 클수록 더 큰 할인율 적용
  - Custom pricing
  - AWS Free Tier
